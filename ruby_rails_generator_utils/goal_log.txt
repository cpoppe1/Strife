how login works  -> sign in info correct  -> got to user dash  -> yes 
(while signed in the pages signup and 

login are not accessible to user) -> login not accessible in signed in  ->

moving into any page via url that does not exist will singed in leads to a logout option screen to logout - --- > yes 


when signing out redirect to home/ signin page/signup

while signed out/ after signing out cannot go back to loged user via back/foward or url indexing

signing up redirects user to their account page signed in
